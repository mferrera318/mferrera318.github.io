				<p>	In June 2022, the Adams administration launched a new housing plan titled “Housing Our Neighbors: A Blueprint for Housing and Homelessness”. The over 90 page plan lays a framework for the city to tackle the rising cost of housing and rates of homelessness in the city. </p>

				<p> Part of the plan, chapter 3, is focused specifically on creating more affordable housing across the city. There’s an emphasis on clearing regulatory hurdles and easing the process of applying, but, notably, there aren’t any metrics to show where new projects will be located or how many units they contain. </p>

				<p> Data published by New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development help to paint a picture of where construction is taking place, and how many units are on offer. </p>

				<p> Since the beginning of 2022, the year the housing blueprint was released, there have been just under 1,250 new projects authorized as affordable housing. Of those projects, the majority are located in the South Bronx, Northern Manhattan, and Central Brooklyn. </p>

				<p> Projects included in the data range from large apartment buildings, to smaller homes with a handful of units. Depending on the project, some units in a building can be listed as affordable housing while the rest are sold or rented as normal. </p>

				<p> Of the over 57,000 available units from all new projects, around 35,500 are designated as affordable housing; approximately 60% of all available units.  </p>

				<p> These are mapped by address on the included map. By scrolling over a data point, you’ll be able to see the total number of affordable housing units per address. </p>

				<p> Absent from the map are 315 buildings listed as confidential in the Department of Housing Preservation and Development’s data. These make up a small portion of the total number of new construction, offering a total of 418 units across the city. </p>

				<p> Of these 315 buildings, 97 are in Brooklyn, 96 are in Queens, 72 are in the Bronx, 32 are in Staten Island, and 18 of them are in Manhattan. </p>
